In this repo, I will analyze data from popular songs. Then predict where the trend is going. I will be using data from Spotify and Genius API. The purpose of this analysis is for me to get familiar with using standard tools in the Data Science stack. Also, to gain insights about popular songs that are perhaps useful for the music industry when producing new songs. 

Through time series analysis, I am going to predict future trends. With the following extracted data:
* word count,
* unique word rate,
* words per minute.
I plan to get the extracted data by combining API calls from Spotify and Genius. Then I will pre-process it and store it on a cloud service for later use.

With pre-processed data, I will apply ML to get predictions about future trends.
